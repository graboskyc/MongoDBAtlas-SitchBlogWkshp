# MongoDBAtlas-SitchBlogWkshp

## Background

This is the github sample repo to go along with MongoDB Atlas Workshops

See the [FollowAlong.md](FollowAlong.md) to follow along, or the blog post on MongoDB's website [located here](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/tutorials/blog-overview/).

The `stitch-cli` folder contains the export of code using the [stitch-cli tool](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/import-export/stitch-cli-reference/) and is a good sample.
