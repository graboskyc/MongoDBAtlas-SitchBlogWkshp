# Basic CRUD Operations

 ## Background
The purpose of this page is if you are following along on your own or want to copy/paste the answers:

## Prereqs
* Deploy the cluster and follow the guide for [DeployCluster.md](DeployCluster.md)
* Once complete, click the `...` button, then "Load Sample Dataset" and confirm the load. This may take several minutes.

* We will use the `sample_mflix.movies` collection. Press the "Collections" button on the cluster, then that database, then that collection to get to the Document Explorer
* We will paste the command below into the box. If using the shell, we should surround the query with `db.movies.find()`

## Find Queries

db.movies.find(
    {
    "actors":"Bill Murray", 
    "year":{$gte: 2000}
    }
    ).sort(
        {"title":1}
    )
```

## Aggregations 1
Here we will want to find all comedies, create an individual document for each country, then group by country to get a count.

| How can you use $unwind to create an individual document for each country? | `$unwind {path: "$countries"}` | 
| How can you use $group to count all the comedies grouped by country? | `$group { _id: "$countries", count: {$sum:1}}`| 

## Aggregations 2
Here we want to restrict output with a calculated field for each movie:
